# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I learned the library mostly from trying different examples offered by the library. The examples not only show how library works but also offers an chance to modify and try different possibilities. After trying and trying, I got to know the logic behind. 
> 
> For example, in this library, function [get] receives an option. The value of options' keys are the default values. I got to know this relationship after trying by myself.
> 
> Thus data type is the easiest understanding part be because of the chances to try out. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> I used to always write the detailed comments and now I know it is unessary. Comments should be in higher level. It means that it summarizes the function, not analyzes it. 
> 
> If I could tell a 142 student, I would say comments can be readable by people not knowing coding. If comments repeat what your codes are doing, they are failure comments.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 15. 

##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I got help from Joel. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I think the installation of jsdoc is not clear. And the issues of octal escape in the reply library was not solved before we started.
